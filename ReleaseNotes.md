--------------------
###Features
* Support for Castle Windsor

* Add IAzureBlobDirectory.ListBlobsSegmentedAsync
* Lock metadata file for the duration of an update so that concurrent access doesn't overwrite values unexpectedly.
* Add overload of IAzureBlockBlob.UploadFromByteArrayAsync that uploads the entire buffer.
* Add minimal page blob abstraction so that lists don't blow up when the container includes a page blob.
* Add flag that causes LightBlue hosts to provide the hosted storage implementation (via the LightBlue APIs)
* Add additional async variations of storage API methods for which async support makes sense.
* Listing of blobs will load metadata when the BlobListingDetails.Metadata flag is specified for standalone containers and directories.

* Support use outside the LightBlue hosts or actual or emulated Azure
* Return values from GetSharedAccessSignature that can be correctly parsed by StorageCredentials when in Standalone mode. This does not produce a usable StorageCredentials instance but this is never validated by Standalone mode.
